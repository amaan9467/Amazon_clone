📌 Project Title: Amazon-Style Navigation Bar UI (HTML + CSS)
📁 Project Type:
Front-End static UI project (No JavaScript used)

🧾 Project Description
This project recreates a simple clone of Amazon's top navigation bar using pure HTML and CSS. It demonstrates a clean and responsive header with key components such as:

Amazon-like logo

Delivery location section

Search bar

Sign-in & Orders links

Cart icon

Responsive alignment and spacing using Flexbox

It is ideal for beginners wanting to master HTML structure and CSS layout skills using Flexbox and positioning.

🧱 Structure & Component Breakdown
1. Navbar Container (<div class="navbar">)
The main horizontal navigation bar is built as a div with Flexbox. It contains several sub-sections, all aligned horizontally and spaced evenly.

2. Logo Section (<div class="nav-logo">)
A square box styled to represent Amazon’s logo area.

Uses background-image or inline image <img> with fixed width and height.

Helps practice display: flex, align-items: center, and spacing using padding.

3. Delivery Location Section (<div class="nav-address">)
Simulates the “Deliver to India” feature.

Includes:

A small location icon (typically a font icon or image).

Two text lines: "Hello" and the actual delivery location.

Uses nested spans and column-flex styling to achieve vertical stacking.

4. Search Bar (<div class="nav-search">)
Central element of the navbar, emphasized with higher width.

Contains:

A dropdown or span for “All”

An input box for search

A search icon box

Styled with:

Rounded corners

:focus or hover states

flex-grow: 1 for input to stretch inside

5. Sign-in Section (<div class="nav-signin">)
Includes:

“Hello, Sign in”

“Accounts & Lists”

Vertical stacking done with display: flex; flex-direction: column

6. Returns & Orders Section (<div class="nav-returns">)
Same vertical style as Sign-in box

Used to practice spacing and hover effects

7. Cart Icon Section (<div class="nav-cart">)
